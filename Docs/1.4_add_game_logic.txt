Add game logic:
    
Use Python to add game logic, like collision detection and scorekeeping. Also create game events
like player movements and enemy actions.

    Create game events:
    
    You'll need to create game events like player movements and enemy actions. This is typically done
    using Pygame's event handling system. For example, to handle the movement of a player object using
    the arrow keys, you would use the following code:

    $ - for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                    player_x -= player_speed
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                    player_x += player_speed
                elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    player_y -= player_speed
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    player_y += player_speed

    Add collision detection:
    
    You'll need to detect when game objects collide with each other. This is typically done using 
    Pygame's colliderect() function. For example, to detect when a player object collides with an enemy
    object, you would use the following code:

    $ - if player_rect.colliderect(enemy_rect):
        # Handle collision

    Keep score:
    
    You'll need to keep track of the player's score as they progress through the game. You can do this by
    incrementing a score variable each time the player achieves a goal. For example, to keep track of the 
    player's score in a platformer game, you might use the following code:

    $ - score = 0

        # Increase score when player collects a coin
        if player_rect.colliderect(coin_rect):
            score += 1

    Update game state:
    
    Finally, you'll need to update the state of the game based on the player's actions and other game events.
    This includes updating the position of game objects, checking for collisions, and keeping track of the 
    player's score.

    Here's an example of how you could add game logic to move a player object using the arrow keys and detect
    when it collides with an enemy object:

    $ - import pygame

        pygame.init()

        window_size = (800, 600)
        screen = pygame.display.set_mode(window_size)

        player_rect = pygame.Rect(50, 50, 50, 50)
        player_color = (255, 0, 0)
        player_speed = 5

        enemy_rect = pygame.Rect(200, 200, 50, 50)
        enemy_color = (0, 255, 0)

        score = 0
        font = pygame.font.Font(None, 30)

        def update_score():
            score_text = font.render("Score: " + str(score), True, (255, 255, 255))
            screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10))

        while True:
            screen.fill((0, 0, 0))

            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    pygame.quit()
                    sys.exit()
                if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                    if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                        player_rect.x -= player_speed
                    elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                        player_rect.x += player_speed
                    elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                        player_rect.y -= player_speed
                    elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                        player_rect.y += player_speed

            pygame.draw.rect(screen, player_color, player_rect)
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, enemy_color, enemy_rect)

            if player_rect.colliderect(enemy_rect):
                score -= 1

            update_score()

            pygame.display.flip()

    This will create a red player object that can be moved using the arrow keys, and a green enemy object that
    will cause the player's score to decrease when they collide. You can customize the game logic to fit your 
    game's needs.
