Here's a high-level overview of the steps to build a simple game:

Install Pygame: The first step is to install Pygame. Do this by running the following command
in the terminal:

$ - pip install pygame


Plan the game: 

Before starting to code, it's important to plan the game. Think about the game mechanics, 
the graphics needed, and any special features to include.

        
Set up the game window:
    
Use Pygame to create a window for the game. Set the window size, background color, and title.


Add game objects:
        
Use Pygame to add game objects like players, enemies, and obstacles. Use images or shapes to 
create these objects.


Add game logic:
    
Use Python to add game logic, like collision detection and scorekeeping. Also create game events
like player movements and enemy actions.


Add sound effects and music:
    
Use Pygame to add sound effects and music to the game. Look for free sound effects and music online, or create them.


Test and debug:
    
Test the game thoroughly and debug any issues that arise. Make adjustments to the game mechanics 
or graphics to improve gameplay.
