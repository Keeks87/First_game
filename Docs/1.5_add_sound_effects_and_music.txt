Add sound effects and music:
    
Use Pygame to add sound effects and music to the game. Look for free sound effects and music online, or create them.

    Load sound files:
    
    You'll need to load sound files using Pygame's mixer module. For example, to load a sound effect file, you 
    would use the following code:

        pygame.mixer.init()
        explosion_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("explosion.wav")

    Play sound effects:
    
    You can play sound effects in response to game events like collisions or player actions. For example, to play
    an explosion sound effect when the player collides with an enemy, you would use the following code:

        if player_rect.colliderect(enemy_rect):
            explosion_sound.play()

    Load music files:
    
    You can also load music files using Pygame's mixer module. For example, to load a background music file, you 
    would use the following code:

        pygame.mixer.music.load("background_music.mp3")

    Play music:
    
    You can play music in the background of your game using Pygame's mixer module. For example, to play background
    music when the game starts, you would use the following code:

        pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)

    This will play the background music indefinitely until the game is quit.

    Here's an example of how you could add sound effects and music to a game:

        import pygame

        pygame.init()

        window_size = (800, 600)
        screen = pygame.display.set_mode(window_size)

        explosion_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("explosion.wav")
        pygame.mixer.music.load("background_music.mp3")

        player_rect = pygame.Rect(50, 50, 50, 50)
        player_color = (255, 0, 0)
        player_speed = 5

        enemy_rect = pygame.Rect(200, 200, 50, 50)
        enemy_color = (0, 255, 0)

        score = 0
        font = pygame.font.Font(None, 30)

        def update_score():
            score_text = font.render("Score: " + str(score), True, (255, 255, 255))
            screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10))

        pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)

        while True:
            screen.fill((0, 0, 0))

            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    pygame.quit()
                    sys.exit()
                if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                    if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                        player_rect.x -= player_speed
                    elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                        player_rect.x += player_speed
                    elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                        player_rect.y -= player_speed
                    elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                        player_rect.y += player_speed

            pygame.draw.rect(screen, player_color, player_rect)
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, enemy_color, enemy_rect)

            if player_rect.colliderect(enemy_rect):
                explosion_sound.play()
                score -= 1

            update_score()

            pygame.display.flip()

    This will play a background music file and an explosion sound effect when the player collides with an
    enemy object. You can customize the sound effects and music to fit your game's needs.
