Plan the game: 

Before starting to code, it's important to plan the game. Think about the game mechanics, 
the graphics needed, and any special features to include.

    
    Choose a game genre: 
    
        First, decide on the type of game to create. Will it be a platformer, a shooter, 
        a puzzle game, or something else entirely? This will help guide the design choices 
        and determine the game mechanics.
    
    Define the game mechanics:
    
        Once chosen a genre, think about the specific mechanics that will make up the game. 
        For example, if creating a platformer, you might need to include jumping, running, 
        and enemy avoidance. Write down a list of the mechanics to include in the game.
    
    Sketch out the game world:
    
        Create a rough sketch of the game world, including the layout of levels, obstacles, 
        and enemies. This will help visualize the game and plan out the graphics needed.
    
    Design the game characters:
        
        Decide on the characters needed for the game, including the player character and 
        any enemies or non-playable characters (NPCs). Sketch out their appearance and 
        any animations needed.

    Choose the graphics style:
    
        Decide on the visual style for the game. Will it be pixel art, cartoonish, or 
        something more realistic? This will help guide the decisions when creating the 
        graphics.

    Think about special features:
    
        Consider adding special features to the game, like power-ups, secret areas, or boss 
        battles. These can add depth and replayability to the game.

    Write a game design document:
    
        Compile all of the ideas and plans into a game design document. This can be a helpful 
        reference to start coding the game, and can also be shared with others who may be 
        helping with the project.
